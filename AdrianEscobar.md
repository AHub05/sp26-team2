## About Me
I am a computer science student at UNC Greensboro with an interest in systems, cybersecurity, and software development. I am also a Navy Reservist, which has shaped how I approach teamwork, responsibility, and problem solving. I enjoy learning new technologies and building a strong foundation in both theory and practical skills.

## My CSC340 Goals
In CSC340, I want to deepen my understanding of software engineering practices, version control, and collaborative development. I hope to become more confident working in team-based environments and using tools like Git and GitHub in a structured, professional way.
